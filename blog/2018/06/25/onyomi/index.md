Lately I have been putting a lot of effort into studying Japanese, to prepare for my upcoming trip to Japan at the end of summer 2018. While learning the readings for various kanji (Chinese character) words, I've noticed that a lot of their pronunciations (_on-yomi_) are related to the Chinese pronunciations in an interesting way. Let me explain my empirical theory about how to to convert Chinese pronunciations into Japanese ones:

<!-- TEASER_END -->

1. <b>Say no:</b> No to too many letters. If the Chinese word has multiple consonants, or too many vowels, drop them.
2. <b>Change the vowels (and sometimes the consonants:</b> Otherwise it would be too easy.
3. <b>Go K-razy:</b> Find ways to put the letter K into the word as much as possible. For some reason it seems like all kanji have lots of k's in them.
4. <b>(Optional) Add some extra syllables:</b> Ususally either つ (tsu) or く (ku)

Sound weird? Let me walk you through some examples.

## Some examples
### 結果 [_jié guǒ_] (result)
1. Say no: the _ie_ and _uo_ are clusters of vowels, so we say no to that, and remove a vowel from each. So we get _ji'go_
2. Change the vowels: change i to e, and o to a: so we get _je'ga_
3. Go K-razy: now change all consonants to the letter k. Also add another k into the middle of the word. So we get _kek'ka_.
4. Skip this step

So we get the final Japanese pronunciation, _kekka_ (けっか). Wow that word has a lot of k's.

### 計画 [_jì huà_] (plan/project)
1. Say no: the _ua_ in _hua_ just becomes a.
2. Change the vowels: _ji_ becomes _jei_ (pronounced just like je but with a "long vowel")
3. Go K-razy: Now make every consonant a K. It becomes _keika_. Also, just add an extra k syllable on the end, _ku_. So we get _keikaku_

This gives us _kei'kaku_ (けいかく), the Japanese pronunciation.

### 価格 [_jià gé_] (price)
1. Say no: _jia_ becomes _ja_, so we have _ja ge_
2. Change the vowels: _ge_ becomes _ga_, so we have _ja ga_
3. Add K's. _ja_ becomes _ka_, and _ga_ also becomes _ka_. And why not, add an extra _ku_, giving us _kakaku_. Note that every consonant has now become the letter K.

We now have the Japanese pronunciation, _ka'kaku_ (かかく).

## More examples of Kanji with K's in weird places or just lots of K's
So you've seen some examples worked through. Look at all those K's!! Although those were somewhat cherry-picked, allow me to give some more examples of on-yomi with tons of extra K's.

| Kanji       | Meaning | Chinese (no tones) | Japanese  | # K's added|
| ---------------|---: |:-------------------:|---:| -----------:
| 改革    | Revolution | gai ge | kaikaku | 4 |
| 過去 | past | guo qu | kako | 2 |
| 目的 | goal | mu di | moku teki | 2 | 
| 地下 | basement | di xia | chi ka | 1 |
| 高校 | high school | gao xiao | kou kou | 2 |
| 強化 | strengthening | qiang hua | kyou ka | 2 |
| 教科 | subject | jiao ke | kyou ka | 2 |
| 空港 | airport | kong gang | kuu kou | 2 |
| 効果 | effect | xiao guo | kou ka | 2 |
| 後悔 | regret | hou hui | kou kai | 2 |
| 結婚 | marriage | jie hun | kekkon | 3 |
| 国会 | Japanese parliament | guo hui | kokkai | 3 |

## Conclusion
This weird method works surprisingly well. Even though this is probably just a confirmation bias, now that I have this idea in mind I always think of Japanese pronunciations as variations on the Chinese pronunciation. And I really notice the large number of K's! These kind of weird things are part of the reason I like learning languages.
