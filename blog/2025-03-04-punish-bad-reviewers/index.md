This year [CVPR](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/) pledged to make all authors
participate in peer review, and reject papers from authors who wrote
low-quality reviews.[^ref] Last week they [confirmed on
Twitter](https://x.com/CVPR/status/1894853624200863958) that they followed
through with this and rejected 19 papers. Presumably this is a tiny fraction of
the overall papers submitted, but I hope this is an effective deterrent for
future authors. At the very least, I'm glad that _some_ major conference tried
something like this!
