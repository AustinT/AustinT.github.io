In the ~8 years since I started my website I've had a bunch of people reach out
to me requesting that a link be added to my "links" page (currently called
[resources](/resources)). The emails I got were fairly personalized (and this
was in the pre-GPT era where I believe such personalized emails would actually
need to be written by a human). Yet the topic of the link they sent was often
_incredibly_ random- like they didn't even read my website. Here are a few of
the weirdest emails for your enjoyment. I've anonymized them and excluded the
links (since I don't actually want to link to them).

## Some emails

**My comment**: children's health, really? This person actually gave a contact
phone number which I was tempted to call but ended up not calling (seemed not
worth my time). I sent a follow up email asking "wtf" but didn't get an honest
answer.

### Is my site a haven for alcoholics?

> Hello Austin,

### Weight loss

> Hello Austin,
> 
> **[COMPANY]** recognizes every person's experience with weight loss is different, managing the challenges can be both frustrating and isolating. We created a guide to help those attempting to be healthier without counting calories:
> 
> **[LINK I DON'T ACTUALLY WANT TO SHARE]**

> 
> Would you share this helpful article with your audience on the below page of your site to further support your readers looking for ways healthily lose weight?
> 
> Thank you in advance,

**My comment**: I was tempted to reply "anybody who relies on my website to
lose weight deserves to be fat" but felt that was too harsh, so instead just
said "I think that if people come to my website for weight loss advice then
they are looking in the wrong place. Thanks for sending this to me, but I will
not put it on my website." This was back when I was being more charitable to
these people and taking the requests seriously.

**My comment**: I can't believe these people had the audacity to claim that linking to their website would make _my_ website be more trustworthy!

## Why is this happening?

I assume this was some kind of search engine optimization (SEO) campaign, and
why my website was chosen perplexes me (I don't imagine I get _that_ many
visitors). After a while I started directly asking people what SEO tools they
were using and to stop, but they never responded to my requests.

Claude Sonnet 4.5's guess was as follows:

> This is almost certainly link-building spam for SEO purposes. The pattern you're describing is standard practice in low-quality digital marketing:
> 
> **The business model:**
>
> - These companies (often rehab centers, healthcare providers, weight loss programs) need to improve their search engine rankings
> - Google's algorithm values inbound links from other websites as a signal of authority
> - They hire SEO agencies or in-house marketers to acquire these links at scale
> 
> **Why the weird personalization:**
>
> - They're using basic scraping tools to extract your name, website URL, and a random page to reference
> - The personalization is just mail-merge templating - enough to get past spam filters and make you think it's legitimate
> - They're not actually reading your content; they're processing hundreds or thousands of sites in bulk
> - The goal is a response rate of maybe 1-5%, so content relevance doesn't matter
> 
> **Why your site specifically:**
>
> - You likely have decent domain authority from academic affiliations or being linked from other legitimate sites
> - Your resources page is easy to identify programmatically
> - Academic/research sites are valuable link targets
> - They're probably working from scraped lists of .edu sites or sites with certain keywords
> 
> The pre-LLM personalization was likely just scraped variables plugged into templates. You can safely ignore or mark as spam.

Seems plausible to me! If anybody has a better guess do let me know.
