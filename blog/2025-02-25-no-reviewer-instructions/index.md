I remember when I first received an invitation to review papers for an ML
conference in late 2020. What surprised me most was _not_ that I was being
invited (even though that was a surprise, since I was just a second year PhD
student who had only just completed writing a paper myself). Instead, it was
the lack of instruction of how to assess the papers: essentially just "write
your reviews by date X", and "evaluate novelty, significance, soundness, etc".
In fact, in all the years since, I think I have _never_ received explicit
instructions for reviewing ML conference papers.[^instructions]

<!-- TEASER_END -->

[^instructions]: The only exceptions are some ML conference workshops and TMLR, which is not a conference and was made explicitly to use different [acceptance criteria](https://jmlr.org/tmlr/acceptance-criteria.html).

Now, ~4 years after receiving that initial review invitation, I have a bit of a
better understanding of why there are no instructions.

1. There are a huge variety of papers, and it is essentially impossible to
   write down a decision tree which applies to all of them (eg, theory papers
   and purely experimental papers probably need to be evaluated differently).
2. If there were guidelines, they would probably need to change every year as
   the field advances.
3. There is genuine disagreement in the community about what kinds of papers
   _should_ be accepted.
4. There is an assumption that people invited to review "already know how to
   review" (eg I was only invited after being on a published paper rather than
   at the start of my PhD)

However, even though I think these arguments have merit, I still think that
more detailed guidelines would be helpful. The high fraction of relatively new
entrants into the ML conference space means that most people don't have the
same kind of shared experience and common standards that were probably present
~10 years ago. As a starting point, I will try to write up my own personal
guidelines in the coming ~1 week. Stay tuned!

This post was checked for LLM alpha (see <a
href="/blog/2025-02-24-llm-alpha/">this blog post</a> for details). I asked
Claude Sonnet 3.5 about lack of instructions in peer reviews, and it
essentially gave suggestions 2,3,4 but not suggestion 1.
