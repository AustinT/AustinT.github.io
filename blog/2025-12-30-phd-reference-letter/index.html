    <p>2025 was the first year where I wrote reference letters for research students

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<div class="alert alert-info">

   <b>Key message:</b>
   if you are a student asking me for a reference letter, please give me at least 2 weeks notice.
   Alongside the request, I'd like you to provide:

   <ol>
<li>A reminder about your contributions during your research project, including the most difficult task(s) you performed or best insights you brought.</li>
   <li>Who your intended supervisor(s) is (are) in the program you are applying to.</li>
   <li>Topic of your proposed PhD research (you could potentially just attach part of your application here).</li>
   <li>(optional) Any intellectual qualities you might like me to highlight (note that these things are subjective and I might not go with your recommendations here; nonetheless doesn't hurt to provide it).</li>
   </ol>

   If you would like a larger batch of letters please outline the entire request in one email if possible.

</div>

<h3 id="working-backwards-letter-as-a-tool-for-admission">Working backwards: letter as a tool for admission</h3>
<p>The point of a reference letter is to help a professor (or admissions
committee) make an appropriate decision to accept or reject a student's
application. I view being a referee a bit like being a defence lawyer: you make
the best possible case for the applicant to persuade the "judge" to admit them,
while still remaining truthful. When assessing PhD applications, I imagine the
key questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Will the student succeed in the PhD program if admitted?</li>
<li>Will the student find a suitable advisor in the department?</li>
<li>Is the student <em>among the best</em> students to admit (compared to other
   applicants)?</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, <em>my</em> goal with the reference letter is to answer these questions as
positively as possible (while still being honest).</p>
<h3 id="standard-outlines-do-answer-these-questions">Standard outlines do answer these questions</h3>
<p>Claude 4.5 suggested the following reference letter outline:</p>
<ol>
<li>Brief context (how long you supervised them, on what)</li>
<li>Overall assessment with comparative ranking</li>
<li>Detailed research contributions with technical specifics</li>
<li>Intellectual qualities and growth trajectory</li>
<li>Fit with target program</li>
<li>Unambiguous recommendation strength</li>
</ol>
<p>A letter with this structure actually answers all the questions above. Points
1-6 all contribute towards success in the PhD program, (3,4,5) all relate to
finding a suitable advisor, and (2,4,5) can be used to compare between
different applicants. So far past letters I've written have mostly followed
this structure.</p>
<p>I'll go point by point through the outline and give my comments.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Brief context</strong>: easy, neutral / objective, no further comments.</li>
<li>
<strong>Overall assessment</strong>: this is most challenging for me personally since I
   am not a professor and have not worked with a lot of students. So far I have
   qualified my assessment with the fact that I am fairly junior, and instead
   commented on whether they seem roughly on par with the PhD students in my
   PhD lab. I try to minimize this section because I don't think my claims here
   carry a lot of weight. Instead, I will try to elaborate more on points 3-5.</li>
<li>
<strong>Research contributions</strong>: here I try to explain what parts of the project
   were challenging and explain the most difficult work that the student did.
   However, I realize I can't always recall precisely what parts of the project
   were the student's initiative vs my suggestions. So far I have erred on the
   side of describing things which unambiguously <em>were</em> the student's work.<ul>
<li>Note to self: take better notes when meeting with students!</li>
<li>Note to students (also repeated below): it would be helpful to get a
  reminder of what some of your best research contributions were so I don't
  miss them!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Intellectual qualities</strong>: this is basically a placeholder to write nice
things about the student. As a default I will write what skills the student
learned in the project and how they seemed to improve. Usually this is a mix of
programming skills and fundamental knowledge about the topic of the research
project (eg Bayesian optimization, Gaussian processes). Beyond this I'll insert
anything (positive) that comes to mind. Eg: curiosity, critical thinking,
communication skills.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fit with target program</strong>: although this feels like a potentially
important section, so far I have not included it in any letters so far. Ideally
what I would write here is:<ul>
<li>How the student's research interests overlap with those of one or more
  professors. However, I would only write this if I actually know the
  professors' work well: the student will probably mention the same
  professors anyway, so I feel I mainly add value if I think I can write a
  better case than the student, which will probably only be possible if I
  understand the professor's body of work better than the student (possible
  if it's within my core research expertise) or if I know the professor
  personally (and therefore have a more nuanced understanding of who they
  would like to work with).</li>
<li>How the student's research interests are "especially" suited to a
  particular department. Usually this is not the case because most
  departments are sufficiently general, but I would mention if I feel the
  department is particularly strong in the student's proposed research
  (something I might be better-positioned to judge than the student
  themself).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Unambiguous recommendation</strong>: basically a summary where I try to re-state
my "overall assessment" (point 2) again.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what-information-should-students-provide">What information should students provide?</h3>
<p>Strictly speaking I don't <em>need</em> any information to write a reference letter,
but as mentioned in the previous section there are some points where
information would be helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li>A reminder of the student's research contributions and the most difficult
  tasks they accomplished (helps to write section 3).</li>
<li>Who their intended supervisor(s) are in the department (helps with section 5)</li>
<li>Their proposed PhD research (helps with section 5).</li>
<li>(optional) Any intellectual qualities the student wants to highlight (used in
  section 4, although I am less likely to include this in the letter compared
  to section 3).</li>
</ul>
<p>The section where extra information from the student can make the biggest
difference is section 5 (fit with the target program). By default this is
something I <em>won't</em> write because I think it's better to say nothing than to
say something that contradicts the student's application. For example, if I
write that the student could work with Professor A but the student only
mentions Professors B,C,D in their application, all parties will probably view
this as a bad sign.<sup id="fnref:prof"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:prof">1</a></sup> A second example: I wouldn't want to write a letter
which assumes the student's PhD research will be similar to the project they
did with me, because if the student's proposed research is different it will
seem like I am <em>not</em> recommending them for their new research direction (and
switching directions between Master's and PhD is super common).</p>
<p>However, a "fit statement" is probably valuable to the department making
admissions decisions because it helps answers Q2 (advisor) and Q3 (is this
student the <em>best</em> student), so I'd like to include it if possible. Providing
me with the information required for a "fit statement" necessarily means that
some parts of the application (the ones the letter might reference) need to be
done (or almost done) <em>before</em> asking for the reference letter.<sup id="fnref:done"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:done">2</a></sup> This
moves the timeline of the entire process forward, leading me to my next point.</p>
<h3 id="timeline-please-give-me-2-weeks-to-write-the-letter">Timeline: please give me 2 weeks to write the letter</h3>
<p>I ask students to give me at least 2 weeks notice to submit the letter
(preferably more). Why is this?</p>
<p>Going through the previous sections, the actual tasks involved in writing a
good letter are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reviewing their research project to create a narrative of what they did and
  what their accomplishments were (~20m).</li>
<li>Reflecting on what their best intellectual qualities were (~15m, usually
  requires a bit of thinking to recall details from previous meetings)</li>
<li>Forming and justifying an "overall assessment" (~10m)</li>
<li>(if info provided) Reviewing their research proposal and proposed supervisors
  to describe the fit with the target program (~20m)</li>
<li>Actually writing the letter (&lt;30m)</li>
</ul>
<p>All together this is maybe ~1.5h of work. The reason I ask for 2 weeks to
complete this work is to account for the fact that at any given time I may have
other tasks competing for my time (eg other research projects, project
deadlines, attending a conference, holiday). It is very unlikely that I will be
unable to find a 1.5h block in a 2 week timeframe, regardless of what other
tasks I have. However, there <em>are</em> times when I might not be able to schedule a
1.5h block in a 5 day window (example in footnote<sup id="fnref:example"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:example">3</a></sup>).</p>
<div class="alert alert-danger">

   <b>What happens if I get less than 2 weeks notice?</b>

   <p>As a general rule I will always write the best letter possible given whatever time constraints I have. The 2 week period is essentially a safety margin to ensure I have the ~1.5h necessary to write a good letter. If due to short notice I cannot spend ~1.5h on the letter, I will probably sacrifice:
   </p>
<ol>
<li>The reflection on the student's accomplishments and intellectual qualities (I will just go with what I remember).</li>
   <li>The "fit to target program" (it is the least essential part of the letter).</li>
   <li>The actual writing of the letter (probably it will come more from a template or previous letter).</li>
   </ol>
</div>

<h3 id="asking-for-multiple-letters">Asking for multiple letters</h3>
<p>The 1.5h quote above applies to the <em>first</em> reference letter. For additional
letters, the reflection/review work can be re-used, saving some time. However,
the "fit with the target program" section <em>cannot</em> be re-used because it will
necessarily change for each letter. Furthermore, from what I have seen each
application usually has a slightly different prompt for its reference letter,
requiring some customization. Therefore, I would conservatively budget <em>1h</em> to
write a strong <em>additional</em> reference letter. This is shorter than ~1.5h for
the first letter, but not <em>that</em> much shorter! <strong>Therefore I would still like 2
weeks notice.</strong></p>
<p>A possible exception to the 2 week notice time is if a student wants a bunch of
similar reference letters around the same time (eg for US PhD applications
which are all due in December). In this case I would prefer a big request up
front with clear timelines instead of a bunch of small requests. This allows me
to plan the work more efficiently. You should send the request <em>around the time
you decide to apply</em>, not just close to the deadline. This will probably be ~6
weeks in advance.</p>
<h3 id="examples-of-good-and-bad-requests-for-reference-letters">Examples of good and bad requests for reference letters</h3>
<h4 id="good-single-request">Good (single request)</h4>
<p><em>Nov 28</em> Hello Austin, I am applying for a PhD in X at University of Y and need
3 referees. Are you willing to write a strong reference for me based on my
[master's research / undergrad research / etc]? The reference is due December
15.</p>
<p>For my PhD research I would like to focus on topic T. I am applying to
University of Y because Professor A is an expert in topic T. I might also want
to collaborate with Professor B.</p>
<p>To help write the letter I've attached my draft statement of purpose for
University of Y's application, an up-to-date CV, and my master's thesis. In
case it is helpful to you when describing my master's research, in my opinion
these were my biggest contributions to the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing a differentiable solver for sparse matrix in Jax (idea to write a
  solver was from you, the implementation was entirely me).</li>
<li>When method K didn't work I suggested studying parameters L,M,N and
  eventually discovered that we had misspecified N.</li>
<li>I suggested the initial modification to method K which we collaboratively
  refined over several iterations to become method Q.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks,
Student</p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: this email is sent &gt; 2 weeks before the deadline, includes a
summary of contributions, information on the intended supervisor / research
topic, and some bonus information (CV + master's thesis) which could be useful
(better to include it than to not include it).</p>
<h4 id="good-batch-request">Good (batch request)</h4>
<p><em>Oct 15</em> Hello Austin, I've decided to apply for PhD programs this year in the
rough topic of T. Would you be happy to write a strong reference letter for
some (or all) of the programs? Their deadlines are mostly in early-mid
December.</p>
<p>My shortlist of programs and advisors is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>University of X:<ul>
<li>Intention: top choice, will definitely apply</li>
<li>Deadline: Dec 5</li>
<li>Potential Supervisors: Professors A, B</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>University of Y:<ul>
<li>Intention: "backup" school, not top choice but hopefully less competitive</li>
<li>Deadline: Dec 1</li>
<li>Note: they only require 2 referees (not 3) and therefore I <em>might</em> not
  need a letter from you here (I haven't decided who it would be best to
  ask)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>University of Z:<ul>
<li>Intention: on the fence, might not apply, just 1 professor.</li>
<li>Deadline: Dec 10</li>
<li>Potential supervisor: Professor Z</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In total this is between 3-8 letters, depending on exactly where I choose to
apply. If you are happy to write the letters, I will send more information
closer to the deadline. For now, here is my up to date CV.</p>
<p>Best,
Student</p>
<p><em>Nov 10</em> Hello Austin, I've made a final decision about where to apply. I will
apply to universities X and Y, but not university Z. I would like you to be one
of my 2 referees for university Y. I am still working on my statement of
purpose for each application, but have attached a rough draft for each one to
give you a sense of what I am thinking. I don't anticipate the key details of
topic/supervisor changing.</p>
<p>When describing my master's research, it might be helpful to note the following
contributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>... (same as before)</li>
</ul>
<p>Best,
Student</p>
<p><em>Nov 28</em> Hello Austin, I've finalized my applications to universities X and Y,
my final application materials are attached to help you customize the letters.
Thank you very much!</p>
<p><em>Dec 05</em> Hello Austin, apologies for the last minute request, but I realized
professor P at university Q would actually be a very good fit. I'd like to
apply for a PhD position at university Q, although the deadline is really soon
(Dec 11). Are you able to write a last-minute reference for me? My application
package for university Q will essentially be the same as for university X
previously, so I imagine you can use a similar letter.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: the initial email was sent well in advance, which would allow me
to anticipate the requests coming later and plan around them. The email with
the final requests came ~3 weeks before the first deadline (lots of time).
Including an initial (unpolished) draft is more helpful than waiting until the
last minute to include the final draft, but it is good to send the final draft
anyway (which the student did). Finally, I realize that not everything goes
according to plan so I included one extra email with an unexpected application.
Although there are only 6 days left, the student gives a clear reason for
applying to this school in particular and makes it clear that the letter for
university X will be most similar. This information would help me save time
drafting the letter and hopefully compensate for the relatively short notice.</p>
<h4 id="bad">Bad</h4>
<p><em>Dec 02</em> Hello Austin, I'm applying for at PhD at X university and would like
you to be a referee. The deadline is Dec 10. Are you able to do it?</p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: this ask has no context about the supervisor / program so makes
it impossible to write a statement about "fit". The notice period is 8 days,
which normally wouldn't be too bad, but this year in particular I was
travelling on those exact dates so wouldn't have had time to write a good
letter. If instead the student contacted me earlier I would have ensured to
submit the letter on Dec 1 (before I went to NeurIPS).</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>My approach to writing a reference letter is to make <a href="#working-backwards-letter-as-a-tool-for-admission">the best possible case
for admitting the student to the
program</a>. This can be
accomplished with a fairly <a href="#standard-outlines-do-answer-these-questions">standard letter
outline</a>. A student can <a href="#what-information-should-students-provide">help
me</a> by reminding me of their top
research contributions and describing their proposed research/supervisor.
Writing a letter that includes all this information will probably take ~1.5h
and I'd appreciate <a href="#timeline-please-give-me-2-weeks-to-write-the-letter">2 weeks
notice</a> to complete the
letter (mostly to account for other tasks I might have on my plate). If I get
less than 2 weeks notice I may need to do a worse job. I'd appreciate the same
2 week notice even if I <a href="#asking-for-multiple-letters">previously wrote a reference
letter</a>, and for large batches would appreciate
an up front notice. I ended with some <a href="#examples-of-good-and-bad-requests-for-reference-letters">example
requests</a>.</p>
<p>As I said at the beginning of the post, feedback is definitely
welcome!<sup id="fnref:claude"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:claude">4</a></sup> You can get in touch with me via email.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="extra-bits">Extra bits</h3>
<p>A few things I haven't fully thought through or formed an opinion on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>What to do if I don't want to write a good letter</strong>? For example if the
  student wasn't good. I haven't encountered this so far.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mentioning weaknesses in a reference letter</strong>: ideally I think a reference
  letter should be a holistic statement and include some weaknesses, apparently
  reference letters skew very positive so mentioning any weakness might kill an
  application. So for now I probably won't include any weaknesses.</li>
</ul>
<div class="footnote">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:prof">
<p>Professor A might think "the student doesn't want to work with me", and Professors B,C,D might think "if the referee mentions prof A but not me then maybe the student is not a good fit for me". <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:prof" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:done">
<p>By "done" I mean "the critical details don't change". For example, if I want to mention a student's intended supervisor and research direction in the letter, these shouldn't change. The writing and phrasing can change. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:done" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:example">
<p>For example, when <a href="../2025-12-18-neurips25">attending NeurIPS this year</a> I had ~3 days of non-stop conference activities (talks, poster sessions, evening socials), then 2 days of holidays with family (who I hadn't seen in a long time), then another travel day. During the few breaks I did have I had some analysis tasks to complete as part of my work at Valence. This would have been an incredibly difficult time to also write a good reference letter!! <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:example" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:claude">
<p>I already got a round of feedback from Claude 4.5 (they suggested I add examples). <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:claude" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">↩</a></p>
