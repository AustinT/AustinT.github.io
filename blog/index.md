title: Austin's Blog
---

This blog mostly exists to help me clarify my own thoughts on various topics and practice writing.
As such, the quality of posts is very mixed.
Even when I do write about things which I have expertise in,
please don't expect publication-quality writing or fact-checking ðŸ˜…

You can browse my blog by:

<!-- NOTE: manually specifying .html extension because the link was broken online -->
- [Per-year archive](/blog/archive.html)
- Its [feed](/blog/index/index.html)
- By [category](/categories/)

Sometimes I write about topics which I know more about. You may find posts with the following tags useful:

- [Bayesian optimization](/categories/bayesian-optimization/), which was essentially my PhD topic.
- [Machine learning](/categories/machine-learning/)
- [Retrosynthesis](/categories/retrosynthesis/), which I also worked on during my PhD.
- [PhD](/categories/phd/) (since I completed a PhD)
- [Websites](/categories/website/), since I created and continue to maintain this website.
- [Blog](/categories/blog/), since this website contains a blog where I am trying to write more frequently.
- [Announcements](/categories/announcement) about me and/or this website.

## Why is my blog _here_ (and not somewhere else)

Good question. For now, 2 reasons:

1. My blog started on my website when I first made a website and I've never been motivated enough to move it.
2. A general desire to avoid "[building my castle in someone else's kingdom](https://howtomarketagame.com/2021/11/01/dont-build-your-castle-in-other-peoples-kingdoms/)."
