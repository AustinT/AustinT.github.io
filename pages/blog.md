title: Austin's Blog

This blog mostly exists to help me clarify my own thoughts on various topics and practice writing.
As such, the quality of posts is very mixed.
Please don't come to my blog expecting publication-quality writing ðŸ˜…

You can browse my blog by:

- Its [feed](/blog/index)
- By [category](/categories/)

In the future,
I also intend for my blog to be the home of research work which is informed enough to be worth reading,
but not rigorous enough to be published.
When I have enough posts like this, I will collate them a bit better.
