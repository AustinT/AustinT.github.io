This blog mostly exists to help me clarify my own thoughts on various topics and practice writing.
As such, the quality of posts is very mixed.
Even when I do write about things which I have expertise in,
please don't expect publication-quality writing or fact-checking ðŸ˜…

You can browse my blog by:

Sometimes I write about topics which I know more about. You may find posts with the following tags useful:

- [Bayesian optimization](/categories/bayesian-optimization/), which was essentially my PhD topic.
- [Machine learning](/categories/machine-learning/)
- [Retrosynthesis](/categories/retrosynthesis/), which I also worked on during my PhD.
- [PhD](/categories/phd/) (since I completed a PhD)
- [Websites](/categories/website/), since I created and continue to maintain this website.
- [Announcements](/categories/announcement) about me and/or this website.
