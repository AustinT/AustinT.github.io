title: Austin's Blog

This blog mostly exists to help me clarify my own thoughts on various topics and practice writing.
As such, the quality of posts is very mixed.
Even when I do write about things which I have expertise in,
please don't expect publication-quality writing or fact-checking ðŸ˜…

You can browse my blog by:

- Its [feed](/blog/index)
- By [category](/categories/)

In the future,
I also intend for my blog to be the home of research work which is informed enough to be worth reading,
but not rigorous enough to be published.
When I have enough posts like this, I will collate them a bit better.
