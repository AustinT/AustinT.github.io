This is a non-extensive list of interesting links and references that I have collected (or written) over the years.
Hopefully you find them useful.

Please email me if any links are broken.

[TOC]

## Learning (general)

- On [this page](/resources/UW_course_reviews) I wrote a brief review of every
  course I took during my undergraduate degree at UWaterloo.
- The flashcard software Anki ([link](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)) is great for
  memorizing things. I have [a page](/resources/anki) with tips on using it.
- [Learning how to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) is a great free online course.

## Language Learning

- [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) is great for learning languages as a beginner.
  Not every course is of equal quality though.
- [Clozemaster](https://www.clozemaster.com/) is great for once you finish Duolingo, or it becomes to easy.
- [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org) is an open-source repository of sentences and translations.

See my [dedicated page](/resources/language-learning/)
for more.

## Computer programming

- [An introduction on how to use Linux, with exercises!](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/index.html)
- [A unexpected lesson on recursion](/resources)
- [My page on how to ask for code help](/not-a-code-psychic/)

## Machine learning / AI

- An introduction to neural networks which I found useful in 2018
  (before I started my PhD):
  <http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html>.

## Writing

- [3 sins of technical writing](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jrs/sins.html):
    1. Boring gibberish at beginning of introduction
    2. A table of contents paragraph
    3. "Conclusions" section without any actual conclusions (e.g., just a summary)
- [Simon Peyton Jones' tips for writing a great research paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/write-great-research-paper/)

## Exercise

Exercising is important!

- [This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16gJJeE1HdUl2BHCL19qAs-P4GrcnFTmibNdW5X3COLU/edit)
  might be a good starting point if you think you are too sedentary but do not know
  what kind of exercise you want to do.

## Books

I have a GitHub repository with summaries of some books I have read:
<https://github.com/AustinT/book-summaries>.

## Software

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is an essential program for version control (keeping track of different versions of files).
- VLC Media player (for playing songs/videos). Great because it is minimalistic and open source.
- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) for memorization/studying.
- [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) for editing sound files (NOTE: have no used in a while, but I found it very helpful in high school).
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is an amazing free program for organizing research papers.
  A must have for any student/researcher.
  Unlike other solutions, Zotero is free to use (for the full version),
  [open source](https://github.com/zotero), and comes with free online syncing of your notes. 
  The only catch is you have to pay for online storage, but you can get around that by using an [external web service](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/webdav_services).
  Apparently google drive/Dropbox are supported now too!
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is currently my preferred text editor (definitely preferred terminal text editor)
- [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) for storing passwords (free and open source)
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is a simple command line program that converts
 text files between different formats, such as LaTeX, markdown, and html.
 A sample use case is to write notes in a simple language (like markdown),
 then convert them to a tex-formatted pdf document or html webpage for better viewing.
- On MacOS, I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) as my default terminal.
- I have used various programs to reduce blue light in the evening.
  For Windows I previously used [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/),
  and on Linux I used [Redshift](http://jonls.dk/redshift/).
  Note that I have not used either of these programs since ~2020.
- On Windows, I previous used this program for plotting simple functions:
  <https://www.padowan.dk/>.
- On Windows, I previously used this program to draw images:
  <https://www.getpaint.net/download.html>.

## Podcasts

Since podcasts change all the time, I have noted the year beside these recommendations.

- (2024) 80,000 hours podcast ([link](https://80000hours.org/podcast/)).
  They have good guests about solving neglected problems.
- (2024) Conversations with Tyler
  ([link](https://conversationswithtyler.com/)).
  He asks very niche questions to a wide range of guests.
  I listen to this podcast mostly for "breadth"
  and for the feeling of accessing an interesting conversation
  about an unfamiliar topic.
- (2024) Conflicted
  ([link](https://messageheard.com/podcasts/conflicted)).
  Introductions to various conflicts int the Middle East.
  It is entertaining, yet informative.
- (2024) Clearer Thinking
  ([link](https://podcast.clearerthinking.org/)).
  Good range of guests and the host does a good job at unpacking
  the guests' arguments and pushing back.
- (2024) EconTalk
  ([link](https://www.econtalk.org/)).
  Good range of guests. Mostly economics,
  but also guests from other areas.
- (2024) Acquired
  ([link](https://www.acquired.fm/)).
  Entertaining "biographies" of famous companies.

## Miscellaneous

- [80000 hours](https://80000hours.org) is a website to help you choose a career that will do good.
  In the past I found their career guide helpful:
  <https://80000hours.org/career-guide/>.
