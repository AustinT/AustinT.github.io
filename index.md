Welcome to [my personal website](/), thanks for visiting!

I am a researcher in science and machine learning.
I currently work at [Valence Labs](https://www.valencelabs.com/),
a research unit within [Recursion](https://www.recursion.com/).
This website functions as a
[CV](/cv),
[research summary](/research),
[blog](/blog) about various topics,
and repository of miscellaneous [resources](/resources).

Feel free to email me if you have questions about this website,
or if you find any issues like broken links.
Note that all opinions and content on this website is completely my own

Some blog posts about the design of this website can be found

### Asking me to put a link to your website on my website

I am happy to link to things which I think are high-quality,
_if_ I can reasonably assess the page's quality.
Please email me if you think this is the case.
Note that if you email me about something completely irrelevant
to my expertise and interests then I will _not_ link to it
because I _cannot_ determine whether it is high-quality.
