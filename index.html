	<h1>Hi there, I'm Austin Tripp!</h1>
	<p>I am a 3rd year undergrad student at the university of Waterloo. 
         My research interests lie at the intersection of chemical physics and machine learning. 
         But both are interesting independently.
         I am currently looking to attend graduate school. Feel free to contact me if interested.
         
         Please note: I am not interested in doing any wet lab work.</p>
