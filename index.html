	<h1>Hi there, I'm Austin Tripp</h1>
	<p>And welcome to my corner of the Internet. 
    I am currently a 3rd year undergrad student at the university of Waterloo. 
     My research interests lie at the intersection of chemical physics and machine learning.
     I am currently looking to attend graduate school starting in 2019. Feel free to contact me if interested.
     <br>
     Please note: I am not interested in doing any wet lab work.</p>
