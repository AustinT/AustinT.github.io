This is the source code for my personal website.
The actual url of the website is: https://austint.github.io/.

Previously, this website was built using jekyll (the default for GitHub pages).
Now it uses [nikola](https://getnikola.com/).
Thanks to the developers of nikola for producing such a useful package.

For instructions on how to add to the website, see the file `DEVELOPMENT.md`.

You are free to use contents from my website to help with the design of your own website.
