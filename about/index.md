# About Austin

My name is Austin and I am currently an undergraduate
student at the university of Waterloo, in Ontario Canada. 
I am interested in all things math. Right now I am immersing 
myself in machine learning/AI, trying to understand the field. 
I have had a varied and interesting university career. 
At first I thought I wanted to be a chemical engineer... and 
then I realized that chemical engineers just move fluids 
through pipes and occasionally heat the pipes (sorry chemical engineers). 
Then I transferred into a program called nanotechnology 
engineering, which I find very interesting. This program taught me that:  

1. Chemistry, and nanochemistry in particular, is extremely challenging, and still not well understood from a theoretical perspective, owing largely to the difficulty of modeling these systems.  
2. Experimental work sucks (a lot)  

As such I am now studying machine learning with the end 
goal of applying it to nanochemistry. However it is possible 
that another interesting problem could swipe my attention 
in the years to come. _(i.e. to professors: I 
am open to hearing about cool, interdisciplinary projects 
for graduate school.)_

In my spare time, I like learning new, interesting things. 
Lately this has consisted mostly of math and programming, 
but until about 1 year ago I was super into language learning. 
I am also quite obsessed with efficiency: I always try to think of ways to optimize my life, even trivially.

## Fun facts about me
- At one point I had a good grasp of 6 languages: English, Français, Deutsch, 普通话, Esperanto, and Toki Pona.
- I like to bake cakes/muffins/cookies, but not really other kinds of cooking. Baking is the most precise form of cooking
- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is the love of my life (so far)
- I can proudly say I have <b>never</b> changed my Facebook profile picture (and I have had Facebook for almost 6 years). I can't make it too easy for  Zuck to take my data ;)
- I would rather read a math textbook than go out drinking (and have declined invites multiple times in the past to do so)
- If you ask me to pick a random number between 1 and 10, I will always pick an irrational number
- As a _nanotechnology engineer_, I have an "approximate knowledge of many things." As a _machine learning engineer_, I have "many knowledge of approximate things."
- e is cooler than π, but π tastes better
