# About Austin

My name is Austin and I am currently an undergraduate
student at the university of Waterloo, in Ontario Canada. 
I am interested in all things math.
Right now I am most excited at the prospect of how AI could exponentially increase the rate of scientific research,
and want to research this further in graduate school.

I have had a varied and interesting university career. 
At first I thought I wanted to be a chemical engineer... and 
then I realized that chemical engineers just move fluids 
through pipes and occasionally heat the pipes (sorry chemical engineers). 
Then I transferred into a program called nanotechnology 
engineering, which I find very interesting. This program taught me that:  

1. Chemistry, and nanochemistry in particular, is extremely challenging, and still not well understood from a theoretical perspective, owing largely to the difficulty of modeling these systems.  
2. Experimental work is not for me (I am too clumsy and don't like tinkering with my hands).

Motivated by this, I believe the right place for me in graduate school is doing
machine learning research for problems motivated by physical sciences
(e.g. materials discovery, drug design, bioinformatics).
I am hoping to find a machine learning/statistics/applied math supervisor with similar interests.

In my spare time, I like learning new, interesting things. 
Lately this has consisted mostly of math and programming, 
but I am also super into language learning,
mostly because I like thinking about different ways ideas can be structured.
I am also quite obsessed with efficiency: I always try to think of ways to optimize my life, even trivially.

## Fun facts about me
- My language skills come and go as I study different things,
 but at certain points I've had a good grasp of French, German, Mandarin, 
 [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto), and [Toki Pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona).
 Right now I am trying to learn Turkish, Japanese, and Korean.
- I really liked spaced repetition: [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is the love of my life so far.
- I like to bake cakes/muffins/cookies, but not really other kinds of cooking. Baking is the most precise form of cooking
- I was a lifeguard/swim instructor for 2 years in high school.
- I can proudly say I have <b>never</b> changed my Facebook profile picture (and I have had Facebook for almost 6 years). I can't make it too easy for  Zuck to take my data ;)
- As a _nanotechnology engineer_, I have an "approximate knowledge of many things." As a _machine learning engineer_, I have "many knowledge of approximate things."
