	<h1>About Austin</h1>
    <p>My name is Austin and I am currently an undergraduate
    student at the university of Waterloo, in Ontario Canada. 
    I am interested in all things math. Right now I am immersing 
    myself in machine learning/AI, trying to understand the field. 
    </p>
    <p>I have had a varied and interesting university career. 
    At first I thought I wanted to be a chemical engineer... and 
    then I realized that chemical engineers just move fluids 
    through pipes and occasionally heat the pipes (sorry chemical engineers). 
    Then I transferred into a program called nanotechnology 
    engineering, which I find very interesting. This program taught me that:
        <ol>
            <li>Chemistry, and nanochemistry in particular, is 
            extremely challenging, and still not well understood 
            from a theoretical perspective, owing largely to 
            the difficulty of modeling these systems.</li>
            <li>Experimental work sucks (a lot)</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
    As such I am now studying machine learning with the end 
    goal of applying it to nanochemistry. However it is possible 
    that another interesting problem could swipe my attention 
    in the years to come. <i>(i.e. to professors: I 
    am open to hearing about cool, interdisciplinary projects 
    for graduate school.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
    In my spare time, I like learning new, interesting things. 
    Lately this has consisted mostly of math and programming, 
    but until about 1 year ago I was super into language learning. 
    </p>
    <h2>Fun facts about me</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>At one point I had a good grasp of 6 languages: 
            English, Français, Deutsch, 普通话, Esperanto, and Toki Pona.</li>
            <li>I like to bake cakes/muffins/cookies, but not 
            really other kinds of cooking. Baking is the most 
            precise form of cooking</li>
            <li><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> 
            is the love of my life (so far)</li>
            <li>I can proudly say I have <b>never</b> changed 
            my Facebook profile picture (and I have had 
            Facebook for almost 6 years)</li>
            <li>I would rather read a math textbook than go 
            out drinking (and have declined invites multiple 
            times in the past to do so)</li>
            <li>If you ask me to pick a random number between 1 
            and 10, I will always pick an irrational number</li>
            <li>e is cooler than π, but π tastes better</li>
        </ul>
