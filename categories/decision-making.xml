but is not always better.
When one needs to make a decision about things for which there is no good data
it might be better to rely on intuition rather than the best proxy available.
Here are some examples where I think an intuition-based approach can be better
than a data-driven approach (but still worse than a data-driven approach with good data):&lt;/p&gt;

Something I thought of recently is what effect this overconfidence has from a Bayesian perspective. 
After a bit of math, I came to the conclusion that having extreme confidence in your beliefs (0% or 100% confidence) implies that you would be unable to change your beliefs if shown evidence to the contrary.
I believe this simple argument suggests that it is very irrational to hold prior beliefs of 0 or 100%. If you do feel this way, then you should choose a very high value (99.99%) or a very low value (0.001%), but always leave some room for error.&lt;/p&gt;
