more commonly called NSGA-II, is a well-established genetic algorithm

for multi-objective optimization (MOO).
In this post I try to extract the key insights/lessons from this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

described in a &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11527"&gt;recent paper from Google&lt;/a&gt;,
is a black-box optimization algorithm deployed
for "numerous research and production systems at Google".
Allegedly, this one algorithm works well on a wide range of settings
(something which the "no-free-lunch-theorem" suggests might not be possible).
In this post I provide my thoughts on what key design decisions likely make this
algorithm work well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since I've started doing internships, the concept of efficient organizations has piqued my interest. In every workplace I have been in, time is always wasted by inefficient transfers of information. For example, long meetings where most of the content is irrelevant to most of the people, or repeated interactions with co-workers where you explain the same thing to all of them. Assuming employees make ~$40/hour, a 1 h meeting with 100 people will cost $4000! If these meetings are not productive, then the company gets a negative return on its time investment, which essentially means the company is wasting money. Clearly organizational efficiency is a financially important objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of an organization's efficiency can be linked to its structure. Long, big meetings are usually a consequence of a strong &lt;em&gt;hierarchical&lt;/em&gt; organization, where work is done by employees, then synced to a centralized node (a boss), and then possibly recapitulated to the workers in a meeting. However, are there better ways to structure an organization that would save time?&lt;/p&gt;
