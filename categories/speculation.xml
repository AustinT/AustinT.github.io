influential machine learning conference in the world (thanks Valence for
sponsoring my trip üôè). In this post I will try to summarize what I learned at
NeurIPS, and cautiously make some predictions for the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

communication, most scientists are not native English speakers. To account for
this, I think that all scientists (especially native English speakers) should
try to write text which is easy to read for non-native speakers. I propose the
following rules for this:&lt;/p&gt;

useful for scientific discovery, after 4+ years I have seen many instances
where BO &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; work. In this post I explain a simple heuristic rule to
decide whether you should expect BO to work well or not.&lt;/p&gt;

from thousands of universities around the world can &lt;em&gt;automatically&lt;/em&gt; connect to
WiFi and any partner institutions using login details from their home
institution. To me it's surprising that it exists, given that it has many
characteristics of projects which academia is &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; at accomplishing:&lt;/p&gt;

beliefs as new evidence arrives. Unfortunately, humans are far from perfect
Bayesian thinkers and therefore may struggle to do this properly. In this post
I explain how conferences help scientists perform better Bayesian inference.&lt;/p&gt;

younger students are considering applying for PhDs in AI for science in this

AI4sci into actionable advice for prospective PhD students.&lt;/p&gt;

but is not always better.
When one needs to make a decision about things for which there is no good data
it might be better to rely on intuition rather than the best proxy available.
Here are some examples where I think an intuition-based approach can be better
than a data-driven approach (but still worse than a data-driven approach with good data):&lt;/p&gt;

While learning the readings for various kanji (Chinese character) words, I've noticed that a lot of their pronunciations (&lt;em&gt;on-yomi&lt;/em&gt;) are related to the Chinese pronunciations in an interesting way. Let me explain my empirical theory about how to to convert Chinese pronunciations into Japanese ones:&lt;/p&gt;
