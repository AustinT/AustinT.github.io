to me requesting that a link be added to my "links" page (currently called
&lt;a href="https://austintripp.ca/resources"&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt;). The emails I got were fairly personalized (and this
was in the pre-GPT era where I believe such personalized emails would actually
need to be written by a human). Yet the topic of the link they sent was often
&lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; random- like they didn't even read my website. Here are a few of
the weirdest emails for your enjoyment. I've anonymized them and excluded the
links (since I don't actually want to link to them).&lt;/p&gt;

support additional features such as automatically generating pages for my
publications). In the end I decided to completely switch from building my
website with Jekyll to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://getnikola.com/"&gt;nikola&lt;/a&gt; instead. This post
explains my thought process for this (in case anybody else is considering
a similar switch).&lt;/p&gt;

a website can benefit one's career. Essentially, a professional website serves
as an accessible source of information about oneself for prospective employers,
coworkers, and employees. Unless you put something horrible on your website,
the effect should at worst be neutral, so there is essentially no downside to
having one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the remainder of the post I will lay out a more detailed case for having
a website and address some potential hesitations people might have about
creating one.&lt;/p&gt;
