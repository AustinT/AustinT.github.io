title: A bit more about me

## Misc personal info

- I am from Toronto Canada.
- I was a lifeguard/swim instructor for 2 years in high school.
- Like baking cakes/muffins/cookies (but don't do it very much nowadays because these foods are very unhealthy üôÅ).
- On another page I describe some of my [beliefs](/misc/beliefs).

## How did I get into the field I am in now?

At first I thought I wanted to be a chemical engineer... and 
then I realized that chemical engineers just move fluids 
through pipes and occasionally heat the pipes (sorry chemical engineers). 
Then I transferred into a program called nanotechnology 
engineering, which I found very interesting. This program taught me that:  

1. Chemistry, and nanochemistry in particular, is extremely challenging,
  and still not well-understood from a theoretical perspective,
  owing largely to the difficulty of modeling these systems.  
2. Experimental work is not for me (I am too clumsy and don't enjoy it).

Motivated by this, I transitioned into doing more programming.
After getting some experience in the software industry
(to learn best practices for coding and development),
I applied to PhDs in materials science and machine learning.
I was motivated to use algorithms to design better experiments,
ultimately saving a lot of time and money in the wet lab.
This led me to work on Bayesian optimization,
which seemed to be the most natural type of algorithm for this setting.
