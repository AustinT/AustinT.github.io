- Wiki for grammar: <http://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/>

### Esperanto

- General Esperanto learning: <https://lernu.net/>.
  I found their [grammar guide](https://lernu.net/gramatiko) to be useful.
  Since I last used this website, a lot of resources seem to require signing in.
- A fairly comprehensive dictionary: <https://www.reta-vortaro.de/>

### French

- Verb conjugation: <https://leconjugueur.lefigaro.fr/>

### German

- Good introductory site for learning German: <http://deutsch.info/en>
- Short podcasts in slow German: <https://slowgerman.com/>

### Japanese

- Good intro textbook online: <https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/>
- Good Japanese-English dictionary: <http://jisho.org/>

### Korean

Disclaimer: I have not studied Korean very much so my opinions are probably not worth much.

- I thought this website served as a good intro textbook:
  <https://www.howtostudykorean.com/>.
