BO's most practically appealing features: &lt;em&gt;modularity&lt;/em&gt;. A "modular" algorithm
is one composed of individual parts which are largely exchangeable. I think BO
is extremely modular, and this is something users want in practice, but BO
papers rarely describe it in this way. This post outlines these points in more
detail and ends with some recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

functions. Examples of such toy functions are Ackley, Rosenbrock, Hartmann, and
Branin. I basically ignore these experiments when I read papers and skip to the
next section. When I review papers (and therefore cannot simply skip sections),
I find my eyes glazing over and feel bored: I don't care about these functions,
don't care about the results, and don't really understand why the authors ran
this experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while I assumed every BO researcher feels this way, but a bunch of recent
conversations have made it clear to me that many people do care. So, in this
post I explain why I don't care at all about benchmarks on toy functions (and
why you shouldn't either).&lt;/p&gt;

for myopic acquisition functions like expected improvement. However, these
acquisition functions are only "optimal" if one's utility function is $u(y) =
y$ (the identity function). Have BO researchers (and BO users) basically
&lt;em&gt;forgotten&lt;/em&gt; to swap this out for "real" utility functions in practice? In this
post I argue that we have basically overlooked this detail (to our own
detriment). It's not &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; hard to fix, but unfortunately the $u(y) = y$
assumption is actually quite deeply embedded, and completely removing it will
make things more complicated. Ultimately, despite the difficulty, I think we
should do it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

of the surrogate model in Bayesian optimization a bit differently than many
other researchers in the field, and this profoundly impacts my view of many
other aspects of BO. Therefore, the purpose of this post is to explain my view
and contrast it with what I believe is the more mainstream view.&lt;/p&gt;

to me requesting that a link be added to my "links" page (currently called
&lt;a href="https://austintripp.ca/resources"&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt;). The emails I got were fairly personalized (and this
was in the pre-GPT era where I believe such personalized emails would actually
need to be written by a human). Yet the topic of the link they sent was often
&lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; random- like they didn't even read my website. Here are a few of
the weirdest emails for your enjoyment. I've anonymized them and excluded the
links (since I don't actually want to link to them).&lt;/p&gt;
