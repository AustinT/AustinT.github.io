described in a &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11527"&gt;recent paper from Google&lt;/a&gt;,
is a black-box optimization algorithm deployed
for "numerous research and production systems at Google".
Allegedly, this one algorithm works well on a wide range of settings
(something which the "no-free-lunch-theorem" suggests might not be possible).
In this post I provide my thoughts on what key design decisions likely make this
algorithm work well.&lt;/p&gt;

but is not always better.
When one needs to make a decision about things for which there is no good data
it might be better to rely on intuition rather than the best proxy available.
Here are some examples where I think an intuition-based approach can be better
than a data-driven approach (but still worse than a data-driven approach with good data):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="Background"&gt;Background&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="https://austintripp.ca/blog/2024-10-07-problems-with-topk-diversity/#Background"&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Diverse optimization"&lt;/em&gt; has been a popular topic in machine learning conferences
for a few years now, particularly in the "AI for drug discovery" sub-field.
In this context, the goal of "optimization" algorithms is to suggest
promising drug candidates,
where "promising" means maximizing one (or more) objective functions.
An example of an objective function could be a docking score
(an approximate simulation of the interactions between a protein and a molecule).
"Diverse" optimization further requires that an algorithm produce multiple
distinct candidate solutions.
This is typically desired when the objective functions don't fully capture
everything we want (for example, a drug candidate also having low toxicity).
The hope is that a diverse set of candidates will have a higher chance of
one useful candidate compared to a non-diverse sets.&lt;/p&gt;

support additional features such as automatically generating pages for my
publications). In the end I decided to completely switch from building my
website with Jekyll to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://getnikola.com/"&gt;nikola&lt;/a&gt; instead. This post
explains my thought process for this (in case anybody else is considering
a similar switch).&lt;/p&gt;

a website can benefit one's career. Essentially, a professional website serves
as an accessible source of information about oneself for prospective employers,
coworkers, and employees. Unless you put something horrible on your website,
the effect should at worst be neutral, so there is essentially no downside to
having one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the remainder of the post I will lay out a more detailed case for having
a website and address some potential hesitations people might have about
creating one.&lt;/p&gt;

I thought I would highlight the interesting use case that I discovered, which requires some special trickery to write a script that executes arbitrary commands.
First, let's quickly review some facts about bash quotes.&lt;/p&gt;

This brought up an important question: how would the fridge be cleaned?
I thought this was an interesting problem and deserved some discussion, both from a practical and a theoretical standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

In this post, I will outline the preparation I did before going, where I was able to use it when I was there, and evaluate my success.&lt;/p&gt;

In doing so, I have made heavy use of &lt;a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html"&gt;scipy's sparse matrices library&lt;/a&gt;.
