Although everybody seems to listen to podcasts these days, some people do not,
and I've found myself explaining several times why I choose to listen to them
(as opposed to just listening to music or audiobooks). This post is essentially
my stock response.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

My overall pitch for podcasts is basically _opportunity cost_: if you have some
downtime that you can't fill with something else (eg while brushing your
teeth), and have the mental energy to listen to something, podcasts can be an
interesting way to make productive use of this time.

Importantly, I won't recommend listening to just _any_ podcast. I'm sure there
are many bad podcasts out there. However, the podcasts which I _enjoy_ all have
some commonalities:

- They sound like a conversation between two people; it's like listening in on
  an interesting conversation.
- The people in the conversation are either people who I respect/admire, or
  people who I would never normally talk to.
- I can tune in and out, it doesn't need 100% of my attention. If I miss a
  point then it's ok.
- It consumes <80% of my mental energy, so I can listen to the podcast while
  doing something else (eg cooking, running)

Here are a couple of my favourite podcasts and a blurb about why I like them:

- **Conversations with Tyler**: First, Tyler interviews a wide range of guests
  who all tend to have smart things to say, so basically every podcast is an
  opportunity to hear from an interesting person who I would never normally
  seek out independently. Second, Tyler usually knows a good amount about
  whatever subject his guest is an expert in, and he just asks about things
  _he_ doesn't know. It often makes the conversation hard to follow, but not so
  hard that I get nothing out of it. The podcast feels like listening to a
  conversation between two experts, but one that you can at least follow (even
  if it is just because he abruptly jumps to the next question).
- **Acquired**: basically two friends telling a story of a company. Feels like
  listening to a good friend tell a story at a bar (albeit a long story).
- **Complex systems** (Patrick McKenzie): he tells stories about tech/finance
  in sarcastically funny ways (makes boring topics interesting). His podcasts
  are short enough that I don't lose interest.

So, if you aren't already a podcast listener, I think you should give it a try!
