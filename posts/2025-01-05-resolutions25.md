Happy 2025! Here are a few goals I am setting for myself this year!

1. Do amazing work at Valence.
2. More writing. Want to average 1 blog post every 2 weeks (= total of 26 blog
   posts in 2025).
3. Use LLMs more for my own learning.
4. Read 6 books unrelated to work (mix of fiction and non-fiction).
5. Learning for drug discovery.
    - _How_ it is done in practice (eg what techniques to "drug-hunters" use)
    - How drugs _work_ (more about the underlying biology)
