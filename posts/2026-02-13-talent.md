Cross-posting my summary of the book "Talent: How to Identify Energizers,
Creatives, and Winners Around the World" from my GitHub:
[link](https://github.com/AustinT/book-summaries/blob/master/non-fiction/2026-02-01-talent.md).

<!-- TEASER_END -->

This is a good book, I appreciated the heterodox advice about how to run
interviews and spot "undervalued" candidates, even if only some of it is backed
by data (this is a field with generally poor data).
