I've been learning Chinese for almost 10 years now, but still make
awkward-sounding sentences when I speak. A few months ago I thought "why not
use LLMs to help me speak more naturally", and found that it does not take much
prompting to get useful feedback. Here is a conversation with Claude 3.5 from a
few months ago:

<!-- TEASER_END -->

**Prompt**:

> I am trying to improve my Chinese. I often say things in an unnatural way,
> even though no individual word is incorrect. I want you to critique my
> writing below. Please point out any grammar mistakes or phrases that would
> sound unnatural to a native Mandarin speaker. Please provide a critique
> sentence by sentence. If there are no issues then say so.
>
> There were some places where I am not sure of my own translation, and put an
> English phrase in brackets. If my Chinese does not match the English please
> correct it. Example: 我走路狗(walk the dog). You should point out that I
> should say 遛狗.
>
> 我需要做一个很难的决定(need to make a hard
> decision)。我写文章，要对每年发表两本的杂志(want to submit to a magazine
> which publishes twice per year)。我差不多写完了一个文章，但是还没完成了(still
> not
> complete)。我可以很快写完，可是质量可能没那么好。我也可以拖延，几个月后提交。质量会好一点，但是我害怕如果给自己太多时间，写文章的时间增加了(~worry
> that if I give myself more time then writing the article will just take way
> longer)。我爱人不知道什么是最好的。

**Response**:

> I'll analyze your Chinese writing sentence by sentence:
> 
> 1. 我需要做一个很难的决定
> - This is grammatically correct but would sound more natural as
>   我需要做一个艰难的决定 or 我面临一个艰难的抉择
> 
> 2. 我写文章，要对每年发表两本的杂志
> - The structure is unnatural. Better: 我想投稿到一本每年出版两期的杂志 
> - 投稿 is the standard term for submitting to a publication
> - 期 is more appropriate than 本 for magazine issues
> 
> 3. 我差不多写完了一个文章，但是还没完成了
> - Grammar error: Double completion marker (了...了)
> - "还没完成" already implies negativity, so no 了 needed
> - Better: 我的文章差不多写完了，但还没有完全完成
> 
> 4. 我可以很快写完，可是质量可能没那么好
> - This is natural and correct
> 
> 5. 我也可以拖延，几个月后提交
> - This is grammatically correct but could be more natural as:
>   我也可以延后几个月再提交
> 
> 6. 质量会好一点，但是我害怕如果给自己太多时间，写文章的时间增加了
> - The structure is a bit unnatural
> - Better:
>   质量可能会好一些，但我担心如果给自己太多时间，写作过程反而会拖得更长
> - 写作过程 sounds more natural than 写文章的时间
> - 担心 is more appropriate here than 害怕
> 
> 7. 我爱人不知道什么是最好的
> - While grammatically correct, 我爱人 sounds slightly dated/formal
> - More natural: 我老公/我丈夫/我妻子 (depending on spouse's gender)
>   也不知道怎么选择比较好
> 
> Overall, your Chinese is quite comprehensible, with only minor grammar
> issues. The main areas for improvement are word choice and making expressions
> sound more natural. You have a good grasp of basic sentence structure, but
> some phrases could be more idiomatic.

Overall this feedback is very good! I assume this will work well for other
languages too.
