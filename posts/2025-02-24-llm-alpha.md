On a recent podcast, [Patrick McKenzie](https://www.kalzumeus.com/about/)
mentioned the idea of "alpha over LLMs": does a publisher produce text with any
meaningful advantage over asking an LLM? I think this is an important question
for anybody trying to regularly write, even if the readership is small (eg this
blog). I interpret this as:

- People should not put out content which is obviously wrong and can be
  corrected by an LLM (eg "I have theory X" where asking an LLM provides clear
  and convincing counter-arguments to X).
- People should also not put out content which is worse than the answer you get
  from asking an LLM (eg the same content but explained less clearly).

I will generally try to uphold this principle in future blog posts.
