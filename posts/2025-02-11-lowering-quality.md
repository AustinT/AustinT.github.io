Since starting my new position at Valence, my efforts to write more on my blog have clearly been successful.[^4years]
However, my internal list of "things I would like to write a blog post about" is growing far faster than I am actually
able to write blog posts about things where I do think it is worth putting an opinion online.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

[^4years]: Note however that the baseline was me not writing anything for 4 years during my PhD, so the bar for "success" was pretty low.

To address this, I will try a new experiment over the next ~3 months.
In addition to "regular" blog posts, I will try something called "quickposts",
where I write a post in a single session of ~1h (including editing), and just post whatever the result is.
My intention with quickposts is _not_ to put low-quality content on my blog,
nor ideas which are not actually thought out, just to force myself to spend a bit less time on writing/polishing/editing structure.
I think these things are important, but given the amount of time I have to spend on a blog, maybe I am making the wrong trade-off?

At the start, I will mark quick posts with a disclaimer like so:

<div class="alert alert-info">
This is a "quickpost": a post which I have tried to write quickly, without very much editing/polishing.
For more details on quickposts, see
