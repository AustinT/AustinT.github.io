Earlier this year I went to Beijing. Here are some miscellaneous travel tips.
What I am writing here is probably not unique or original, treat this just as
my personal emphasis / endorsement.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

- Apps: download amap (or baidu), didi, Wechat (including linking a foreign
  credit card), letsvpn, pleco translation app. Download *before* going. If you
  feel paranoid about data security, do this on a separate phone.
- Get SIM card ASAP. You often need a SIM card to connect to wifi.
- Advance bookings for places which have long queues for tourists:
    - national museum
    - forbidden city
    - _Maybe_ summer palace and great wall (depending on season)
- Food to try:
    - malatang
    - peking duck
    - zhajiangmian
    - roubing (meat cakes)
- Vegetarian options can be a bit hard to find, maybe search this in advance.
- Look up how to use a squat toilet if necessary
- Carry some toilet paper with you (not all toilets provide it)
