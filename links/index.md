# Austin's Links
This is a non-extensive list of interesting links and references that I have collected over the years, and put the effort into linking on my website. I hope they are of use to you.

## Courses
- [Course reviews](/links/UW_course_reviews) of courses I've taken at UWaterloo

## Learning in General
- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is an amazing piece of software for memorization.
 Click [here](/links/anki) for more tips on how to use it.
- [Learning how to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) is an amazing free online course
- [Clearer Thinking](https://www.clearerthinking.org/) is a website with quizzes
 for you to test your thinking.
 Their tests could point out irrational behaviours/beliefs and help you make
 better decisions and life choices.

## Language Learning
- [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) is great for learning languages as a beginner.
- [Clozemaster](https://www.clozemaster.com/) is great for once you finish Duolingo, or it becomes to easy.

## Misc Programming/Machine Learning
- [A guide to become a master of the \*nix terminal](https://skilstak.io/terminals/#terminal-masters).
 Seriously this website has so much good content.
- [A really good list of tensorflow projects](https://github.com/jtoy/awesome-tensorflow)
- [Great intro to neural nets](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html)
- [A great explanation of recursion](/links)

## Organizations
- [80000 hours](https://80000hours.org) is a website to help you choose a career that will do good. If you are a student (or if you aren't a student), I recommend reading their [career guide](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/)

## Lifestyle
- Robert Wiblin (founder of 80000 hours) put a quick guide to exercise online, suited more to those who want to exercise because they rationally see that they pretty much have to. 
 I found it pretty useful.

## Jokes
- [Some unconventional proof techniques](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/video-lectures/lecture-3-strong-induction/MIT6_042JF10_proof.pdf)


# Austin's Recommended Programs
These are some programs I consider essential for any computer

## Both Windows and Linux
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is an astounding program for version control (keeping track of different versions of files). A must have, especially in the software industry.
- VLC Media player (for playing songs/videos). Great because it is minimalistic and open source.
- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) for memorization/studying.
- [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) for editing sound files. This program saved my life in high school music class!
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is an amazing free program for organizing research papers. A must have for any student/researcher. Unlike other solutions, zotero is free to use (for the full version), [open source](https://github.com/zotero), and comes with free online syncing of your notes. The only catch is you have to pay for online storage, but you can get around that by using an [external web service](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/webdav_services) Apparently google drive/dropbox are supported now too!
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is currently my preferred text editor (definitely preferred terminal text editor)
- [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) is currently what I use to store passwords securely.

## Windows Only
- [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) is an amazing program that changes your screen colour at night to prevent eye fatigue and make it easier to sleep after using the computer.
- Notepad++ for text editing
- [PDF-XChange Viewer](https://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-viewer) PDF-XChange Viewer is a nice fast PDF viewer that remembers what page you left off on when reading. The free version is good enough to use in my opinion.
- [Graph](https://www.padowan.dk/) is a great free program for plotting functions.
- [paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/download.html) is a free program like Microsoft paint, but a lot better.


## Linux Only
- [Redshift](http://jonls.dk/redshift/) is essentially f.lux but for linux.

# Books
I am trying to keep a reading list now on my github ([link](https://github.com/AustinT/book-summaries)). Feel free to check it out for my notes and summaries. Note that it is definitely still a work in progress.
