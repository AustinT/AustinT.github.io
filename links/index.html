    <h1>Austin's Recommended Programs</h1>
    <p>These are some programs I consider essential for any computer</p>
    
    <h2>Both Windows and Linux</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> 
        is an astounding program for version control 
        (keeping track of different versions of files).
        A must have, especially in the software industry.</li>
        <li>VLC Media player (for playing songs/videos)</li>
        <li><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> for memorization/studying.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a> for editing sound files. 
        This program saved my life in high school music class!</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> is an amazing free program for organizing 
        research papers. A must have for any student/researcher. Unlike other solutions, zotero is 
        free to use (for the full version), <a href="https://github.com/zotero">open source</a>, 
        and comes with free online syncing of your notes. The only catch is you have to pay for 
        online storage, but you can get around that by using an 
        <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/webdav_services">external web service</a>. 
        Apparently google drive/dropbox are supported now too!</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Windows Only</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://justgetflux.com/">f.lux</a> 
        is an amazing program that changes your screen colour at night 
        to prevent eye fatigue and make it easier to sleep after using the computer.</li>
        <li>Notepad++ for text editing</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-viewer">
        PDF-XChange Viewer</a> is a nice fast PDF viewer that remembers what page you left off on 
        when reading. The free version is good enough to use in my opinion.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.padowan.dk/">Graph</a> is a great free program for 
        plotting functions.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.getpaint.net/download.html">paint.net</a> is a free program like 
        Microsoft paint, but a lot better.</li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Linux Only</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://jonls.dk/redshift/">Redshift</a>
