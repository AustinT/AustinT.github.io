# More Information about Anki
Anki is an extremely useful piece of software for learning new things.
This page links to some resources that I have found useful to learn/use Anki.
It is meant to be updated on an ongoing basis.

- The [user manual](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html) is long but surprisingly readable.
 Skimming the introduction is not a bad way to start.
- This [blog post](http://rs.io/anki-tips/) is a popular one for common Anki mistakes.
- This [blog post](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html) by Michael Nielsen[^1] gives an interesting overview on the importance of memorization, and his experience using Anki to understand new research fields.

[^1]: This guy's work is really good in general. Wrote a very useful [guide to neural networks](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/), and one of the [main textbooks on quantum computing](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computation-Information-10th-Anniversary/dp/1107002176/),
